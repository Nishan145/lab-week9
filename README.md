# ðŸŽ¯ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

# I managed to allow the user to be able to sign up through clerk and be able to post comments and see what they wrote in their posts section, I did not manage to create a profile for the user.

# ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

# I could not be able to see posts in a global timeline and creating posts in your profile section.

# ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

# I think overall the codealong helped me greatly in understanding next.js this project helped me understand more than the previous weeks, I think had I given myself more time on this project instead of catching up I think I would have gotten a bit further in but im still quite struggling overall in react and next.js for now.
